# The blue paradox: Preemptive overfishing in marine reserves

This repo contains the code and data for reproducing McDermott, Meng, *et al*. (PNAS, 2018): "[The blue paradox: Preemptive overfishing in marine reserves](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802862115)". Click on the "fork" button at the very top right of the page to create an independent copy of the repo within your own GitHub account. Alternately, click on the green "clone or download" button just below that to download the repo to your local computer.

## Software

The analysis for this project was conducted in both *R* and STATA. We have tried as far as possible to make the analysis fully reproducible using only the former, since it is an open-source programming language. You should be able to reproduce essentially all of the key results and figures using *R* on its own. However, some of the figures from the paper were produced using STATA and you will need to execute these (close-sourced) scripts to exactly match these cases. See the relevant README files in the `R` and `STATA` sub-directories for more information.

## Problems

If you have any trouble running the code, or find any errors, please file an issue and we'll look into it.
